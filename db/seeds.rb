    description: "A fabulous sale requiring a unique approach from Anita and Sue.  First, it starts off as a “By Appointment Only” sale on Wednesday and Thursday.  The homeowner was a clothes horse who filled her home with designer clothing, shoes, purses, belts, furs, hats – everything necessary to put her best professional foot forward.  Her clothing ranges from size 2~6; shoe size 5 ½ ~ 6.  In order for shoppers to have the time (and space) to try things on, Anita and Sue will limit the number of people inside the home the first two days.  Then starting Friday, the sale will be open to the public ... no appointment necessary.  Ladies, you won’t be able to resist designer clothing from Escada, Armani, Vera Wang, BCBGMAXAZRIA, and others; designer purses by Fendi, Michael Kors, or purses made from exotic skins like alligator; shoes and boots (from ankle to knee) by Gucci, Prada, Bruno Magli, Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik, Stuart Weitzman, and others; and gorgeous fur coats and fur trimmed sweaters.  Even the belts are designer ... Escada and Nancy Gonzalez.  It’s a boutique estate sale from start to finish.",
